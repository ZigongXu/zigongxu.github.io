bio: |
  Zigong Xu is a postdoctoral researcher specializing in space weather and high-energy astrophysics. His work focuses on solar energetic particles, radiation environments in the heliosphere and at the lunar surface, and the interaction between energetic particles and space plasma. He combines observational data from space missions with statistical modeling and machine learning techniques to address fundamental problems in space physics and radiation risk assessment. The personal website is still developing. Please looking forward to the progress.

Welcome to my research website! 

I'm Zigong Xu, a postdoctoral researcher at the California Institute of Technology, specializing in space weather, high-energy astrophysics, and radiation environments in space.

## About This Site

This website serves as a hub for my research activities, including:

- **Publications**: My latest research papers and publications
- **Projects**: Ongoing research projects and collaborations
- **Talks & Events**: Conference presentations and invited talks
- **Research Interests**: Solar energetic particles, radiation risk assessment, and space plasma physics

## Research Focus

My work focuses on:

- **Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs)**: Understanding the acceleration and transport of energetic particles from the Sun
- **Radiation Environments**: Assessing radiation hazards in the heliosphere and at planetary surfaces (Moon, Mars)
- **Space Weather**: Analyzing data from space missions like Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, and Chang'E-4
- **Machine Learning**: Applying ML techniques to space physics and space weather prediction
